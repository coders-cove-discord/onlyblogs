# Coder's Cove Website ✌️

### Common links

- [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/coders-cove-discord/projects/1/views/1).

### Standards

- Don't push directly to `main` if you're working with another dev, PR from another branch.
- Spam Github Issues with "todos", assign yourself when you're doing them to keep other devs in the loop.
- Use the Project Board as secondary, because sometimes it gets messy.
