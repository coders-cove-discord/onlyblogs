### Standards

- Don't push directly to `main` if you're working with another dev, PR from another branch.
- Fill the [Github Issues](https://github.com/coders-cove-discord/website/issues) with "todos" and assign yourself when you're doing them to keep other devs in the loop.
- Use the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/coders-cove-discord/projects/1) as secondary, because sometimes it gets messy.
